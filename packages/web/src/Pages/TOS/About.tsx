          {`The total portfolio approach means that the present value of future
          savings and retirement income, valued using the bond rate, is
          counted as bonds in the portfolio. A fixed asset allocation is
          maintained on this total portfolio. Retirement withdrawals are
          calculated by amortizing the total portfolio over retirement years
          (amortization based withdrawal).`}

        <p className="mt-6">
          The advantage of the total portfolio approach is that total risk is
          kept consistent from year to year. This has two benefits:
          <ul className="list-decimal list-outside pl-5">
            <li className="mt-2">
              The more even spreading of risk across years reduces the total
              risk that the retiree would need to take to achieve a given
              expected return.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-2">
              It prevents surprises like risk increasing unexpectedly as the
              real value of a pension declines and the retiree relies more
              heavily on the savings portfolio.
